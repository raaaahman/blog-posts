# Getting Started

What I'll discuss here will be very theoric about setting up your journey to learning some new skills. It could apply to other fields than programming, but since the theme of this blog is specifically to discuss the learning of programming skills, I will use it for examples. But whatever field you're wanting to learn, you'll have to start somewhere that's for sure. So, enough chatter, let's jump right in the subject.

## Initialize your journey

Maybe you've already started to learn that skill of your dreams, or maybe you're wondering when will be the good time to start off. In this case, what about now?

You may be waiting for the **perfect conditions**, like having some vacations or finishing important work that is sucking your time at the moment, which seems to be a good reason to not engage in other activities at the same time. But there's a big probability you will just have an almost as important task or busy schedule after that point, even if you did not plan it at the moment. Meanwhile, you're just loosing occasions to learn those skills you really care about.

Also, let me shift that the other way around. Let's just imagine the planets will align perfectly in a near future, and you will have an opportunity to dedicate lots of time to your learning. Then, wouldn't it be awesome that you've already got an insight of the basics skills you want to have, so you can concentrate on the more difficult concepts. Sounds tempting, right?

There's no magic involved here, the sooner you start, the more advanced you'll be in two months, or the next year.Even if you can spend only 10 min a day, you're still going to make some progress, slight progress that will **add up over time**.

## Set up your plan

Let's pretend my awkward babble convinced you to start learning right now (or you might have this idea in mind since the beginning). That's great, but how do we do that? You may as well jump in the action right now, and that's still be a more profitable move than delaying it. But it would be better that you don't tire out your early motivation too quickly, by following an inefficient process, so **you need a plan**. You have to trust me for this, I have wasted so much time going back and forth in my developer's journey because of the lack of a plan so I must recognize how crucial it is.
