## Results may vary

Like I wrote previously, you can't just rely on the bootcamp to learn a complete field in such a short timespan. You are however building your *developer mindset*, a mindset that will drive you to use every working day and every task you're assigned to as opportunities to learn something new or to refine your skills.

You may not feel like a 'real' developer right after the bootcamp (\*cough\* \*cough\* impostor syndrome... \*cough\*), but I'll argue that being a developer is not a goal, but rather a **process**. A process into which you've taken your first steps and you'd better keep the pace of day-to-day learning and coding.

## In the end

Are bootcamp worth it? I can't just give a definitive answer as it really depends on you. But I can higlight some key considerations here:

Bootcamps are great if you have habits of learning by yourself and committing to it. It will strenghten these habits and you will have a dedicated period where you'll focus on coding and be surrounded by people sharing the same objectives, boosting each other motivation and helping or asking for help when things get tough. I wouldn't recommend you just jump in a bootcamp without a prior trial of self-teaching in the field you're gonna be investing yourself in though, as it is a serious investment in both time and money. (Luckily, there is plenty of content to start learning by yourself on the web. I ,for one, started with Khan Academy exercises and lessons before realizing how much I love coding)

You may not get your dream job as you just completed your bootcamp, in fact it is slightly probable, and you may even go back to a fridge-filling job in the meantime you find a programming job. This is totally okay. Mastering a field take time, and learning development is a consistent process, don't stop right after your first job refusal! Instead continue coding, find an internship if you have the opportunity, build a project for free, like for a non-profit or a family member's business, or even your own personnal project. Then you'll have something to show to companies when you'll apply to job opportunities, even if it's not really good, they will notice your commitment and passion for coding, two qualities that are highly valuable for professionals!

I did start as a freelancer right after my bootcamp, and I wouldn't really recommend it. As it just added up fields to learn on top of development and professional attitude (it is really important, especially if it's your first job), like financial management, marketing and administration. I shall mention that I have encountered other bootcamp developers that chose that way too and managed well better than me. It depends on one's personality I guess, so just be warned.

You may (or not, but we'll just pretend) want to ask what I've been doing for these two years appart failing at managing my own business, but I feel there is already pennies for your tought in this post. I'll get in touch soon though, no worries.

Happy learning folks!
