# Dev In Details

This repository contain the posts from my personal blog: [Dev In Details](https://devindetails.com)

In these, I go through the process to learn programing through good practices and effective learning processes (hopefully!). This is based on my personal trial and errors, as much as the actual cursus I'm following at [IPI Lyon](http://www.ipi-ecoles.com/category/campus/lyon/), the books I read and the talks I attend to, mostly through [meet ups](https://www.meetup.com/).

I consider this blog as a learning tool, because I firmly believe in 'learning through teaching'. I've uploaded these posts on GitHub in case any readers would have good advices to give or find mistakes to correct.
